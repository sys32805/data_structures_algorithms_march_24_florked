in classic way people use interface the make a instance in new file then overriding the same method
but in lambad thing are different
eg. webpage w1 = new webpage();
    w1.sayMyName("rohit");
    output: "rohit;
in lambda way there is not need to overriding the same method

eg
  wepage w1 = (name)->{System.out.println("rohit")};
  call w1.sayMyName("rohit");
  output: "rohit":
  Note:Interfaces need to present so lamda can understand the which method to overload
  Note:lambada expresion can be used in functional interface

what is functional interface
a functional interface is interface which has only one method and other deafult and static methods
are allowed
in java 1.8
